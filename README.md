# smartfourwaycrossroad

## Overview

The "smartfourwaycrossroad" project is designed to manage traffic at a four-way intersection intelligently. This project involves the use of algorithms to control the traffic lights based on real-time traffic data, optimizing the flow of vehicles and minimizing waiting times.

## Project Files

- **2.lccd.pdsprj**: Project file containing the design and configuration for the smart four-way crossroad system.
- **main.cpp**: The primary source code file where the logic for the traffic management is implemented.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.

## Features

- Real-time traffic management.
- Dynamic traffic light control.
- Easy to integrate with different types of sensors.
- Scalable and adaptable to various intersection sizes and traffic conditions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/strecshazovskiOK/smartfourwaycrossroad.git
   ```

2. Open the project using your preferred development environment.

3. Build the project using the provided `main.cpp` file.

## Usage

To run the traffic management system, execute the compiled project. Ensure that the required sensors and other hardware components are connected properly and configured according to the project settings in the `2.lccd.pdsprj` file.
